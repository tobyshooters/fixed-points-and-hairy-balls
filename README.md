# First Steps into Geometry and Topology

During my last quarter of college, I took an introductory real analysis class.
We had a single lecture on point-set topology consisting of a series of
definitions: metric spaces, neighborhoods, open and closed sets, etc. The
lecture stood out to me as the most intuitive way to describe the very
hand-wavy notions that I had learned in Calculus. Beyond epsilon-delta, this
language let me think geometrically.

Despite having graduated, I've decided to pursue this line of knowledge
further. This repository contains notes from these further studies.

My current goal is to work my way to understanding the Brouwer fixed-point
theorem and the Hairy Ball theorem.
